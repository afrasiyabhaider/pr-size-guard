📏 PR Size Guard — See Pull Request Size at a Glance

Tired of opening a GitHub Pull Request only to discover it has 2,000+ lines of changes? PR Size Guard shows you the PR size instantly with a color-coded badge.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 WHAT IT DOES

When you open any Pull Request on GitHub, PR Size Guard automatically:
• Detects the number of files changed
• Counts lines added and deleted
• Displays a badge: Small, Medium, Large, or Critical

The badge appears right next to the PR title — no clicks needed.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚦 SIZE CATEGORIES

🟢 Small — Quick review (≤5 files, ≤100 lines)
🟠 Medium — Normal review (≤15 files, ≤400 lines)
🔴 Large — Needs focus (≤30 files, ≤1000 lines)
⛔ Critical — Consider splitting (>30 files or >1000 lines)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚙️ CUSTOMIZABLE

Don't like the defaults? Click the extension icon to set your own thresholds:
• Max files for each category
• Max lines for each category
• Settings sync across your devices

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✨ KEY FEATURES

✓ Instant visibility — Badge appears in PR header
✓ Smart classification — Uses the stricter of files vs lines
✓ Detailed tooltip — Hover to see full breakdown
✓ SPA-aware — Works with GitHub's navigation
✓ Customizable thresholds — Set your team's standards
✓ Dark mode support — Matches GitHub's themes
✓ Zero configuration — Works out of the box
✓ Lightweight — No performance impact

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔒 PRIVACY FIRST

• No data collection
• No analytics or tracking
• No account required
• No external servers
• Runs 100% locally in your browser

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 WHY PR SIZE MATTERS

Studies show code review quality drops significantly after ~400 lines. Large PRs:
• Take longer to review
• Hide bugs more easily
• Cause reviewer fatigue
• Delay shipping

PR Size Guard helps you identify these PRs before you start reviewing.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🛠️ PERFECT FOR

• Software developers
• Code reviewers
• Engineering managers
• Open source maintainers
• DevOps engineers
• QA engineers

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 PERMISSIONS EXPLAINED

• "Read and change your data on github.com" — Required to read PR stats and inject the badge
• "Storage" — Saves your custom thresholds

We request minimal permissions. No access to your code or GitHub account.
